# Memory Bank Overview

This Memory Bank contains comprehensive documentation for the Next.js Blog Assignment project. After each memory reset, I must read ALL these files to understand the project context and continue development effectively.

## Core Files (Read in Order)

1. **`projectbrief.md`** - Foundation document with requirements and constraints
2. **`productContext.md`** - User experience goals and problem definition  
3. **`systemPatterns.md`** - Architecture patterns and component relationships
4. **`techContext.md`** - Technology stack and development setup
5. **`activeContext.md`** - Current work focus and recent changes
6. **`progress.md`** - Implementation status and what's left to build
