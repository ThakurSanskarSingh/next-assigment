# Active Context: Current Project State

## Current Work Focus
**Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up comprehensive project documentation to enable effective development continuation after memory resets.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory-bank directory structure
- Established core Memory Bank files:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Foundation document with requirements and constraints
  - `productContext.md`: User experience goals and problem definition
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture patterns and component relationships
  - `techContext.md`: Technology stack and development setup

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**:
   - Create `progress.md` to document current implementation status
   - Review existing codebase to understand what's already built
   - Document any gaps between WBS plan and current implementation

2. **Project Assessment**:
   - Analyze existing components and their functionality
   - Test current authentication system
   - Verify API routes and data operations
   - Check responsive design implementation

3. **Development Priorities** (based on WBS):
   - Ensure all core functionality is working
   - Fix any broken features or missing implementations
   - Optimize performance and user experience
   - Add any missing error handling or loading states

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Server-First Approach**: Prioritizing Server Components for performance
- **File-Based Storage**: Using JSON files instead of database for simplicity
- **NextAuth.js Integration**: Implementing role-based authentication
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach for rapid development

### Current Implementation Status
Based on file structure analysis:
- ✅ **Project Setup**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind configured
- ✅ **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with credentials provider implemented
- ✅ **Basic Routing**: App Router structure with protected routes
- ✅ **Components**: Core components like BlogCard, Navigation, PostForm exist
- ✅ **API Routes**: CRUD operations for posts implemented
- ✅ **Data Layer**: JSON-based data storage with utility functions

### Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Component Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **File Organization**: Clear separation between components, containers, and utilities
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage throughout
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks with user-friendly error messages
- **Loading States**: Skeleton UI and suspense boundaries for better UX

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Development Approach
- **Incremental Development**: Following WBS structure for systematic progress
- **Documentation-First**: Maintaining comprehensive Memory Bank for continuity
- **Performance-Conscious**: Leveraging Next.js 15 features for optimization
- **User-Centric**: Focusing on responsive design and accessibility

### Technical Insights
- **App Router Benefits**: Improved performance with Server Components
- **Authentication Complexity**: NextAuth.js v5 beta requires careful configuration
- **File-Based Storage**: Simple but requires careful concurrent access handling
- **Tailwind Integration**: Rapid styling with consistent design system

### Challenges Identified
- **Beta Dependencies**: NextAuth.js v5 beta may have stability issues
- **File Concurrency**: JSON file operations need proper error handling
- **Static Generation**: Balancing SSG benefits with dynamic content needs
- **Type Safety**: Ensuring proper typing across client/server boundaries

## Current Environment Status
- **Development Server**: Ready to run with `npm run dev`
- **Build Process**: Configured with TypeScript and ESLint
- **Git Repository**: Connected to GitHub with proper commit history
- **Code Quality**: Husky hooks and lint-staged configured for consistency

## Memory Bank Maintenance Notes
- **Last Updated**: Initial creation during Memory Bank setup
- **Update Triggers**: After significant feature implementations or bug fixes
- **Focus Areas**: Track progress against WBS milestones
- **Documentation Priority**: Keep activeContext.md and progress.md current

## Immediate Action Items
1. Complete Memory Bank initialization with progress.md
2. Run development server to test current functionality
3. Identify any broken features or missing implementations
4. Update progress.md with detailed status of each WBS milestone
5. Plan next development phase based on current state assessment
